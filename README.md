# 📈 Flight Departures Data Analysis: Classification vs. Forecasting Approaches

## 🛫 Project Overview
This project explores two different approaches to analyze and predict flight departures data:

- **Departure Classification Model:**  – predicting departure categories using machine learning classifiers.
- **Departure Forecasting Model:**  – predicting future departure values using time series forecasting techniques.

The goal is to evaluate both strategies and understand which modeling approach provides better insights based on the problem type.

## 🛠️ Problem Statement
Flight operations and planning teams often require insights into departure patterns for better scheduling and resource allocation. Depending on the objective (categorization or prediction of future numbers), different models may be required.

This project addresses:
- **Can we classify departure levels effectively using machine learning models?**
- **Can we forecast future flight departures to support operational planning?**

## 💡 Solution Approach

### 🔹 **Classification Approach**
- Performed data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Applied classification models like **Decision Trees**, **Random Forest**, etc.
- Evaluated model performance using **Precision-Recall curves** and **ROC curves**.

### 🔸 **Time Series Forecasting Approach**
- Used **ARIMA**, **ETS**, and other time series models from R’s `forecast` package.
- Focused on forecasting future departure counts based on historical data.
- Visualized forecasting outputs and evaluated model accuracy.

## 🎯 Key Outcomes
- Provided a clear comparison between **classification-based modeling** and **forecasting-based modeling**.
- Helped identify the right modeling approach depending on the business question (categorization vs. prediction).
- Demonstrated data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation techniques in both cases.
